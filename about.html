      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Nikola Skibicka. I love tattoo art and want to make it my career. I've always been amazed by the details and stories in tattoos. What started as an interest is now my dream job.
        
        Tattooing is more than a job for me; it's a way to express myself and connect with people.
        
        I'm looking for a tattoo apprenticeship. I know it takes hard work and learning from skilled artists. I'm ready to dive in, learn a lot, and improve my skills.
        
        I'm excited about becoming a professional tattoo artist.

        If you want to connect, talk about working together, or offer an apprenticeship, contact me at skibickanikola@gmail.com or 07368512315.
        
        I can't wait to hear from you!<p>
